# First Demo Repo

This is my first repository.
 
**Author:** Akash Gowda

### Steps Followed:

1. **Started using Git**  
   I created my first Git repository via the GitHub website and selected the option to add a `README.md` file.

2. **Installed VSCode & Git Bash**  
   I installed both **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** and **Git Bash** on my local machine.

3. **Verified Installation**  
   I ran the following command to check if Git was installed successfully:  

   git --version
4. **Created a Local Folder**
On my local machine, I created a folder where all my repositories will be stored.

5. **Cloned the Repository**
In the VSCode terminal, I used the following command to clone my GitHub repository to my local machine:
git clone https://<your-repository-link>.git

You can find this HTTPS link by clicking on the Code button in your GitHub repository.

6. **Useful Commands:**
List the directory contents: ls 
List all contents, including hidden files (Git Bash/Linux): ls -a
List all contents, including hidden files (VSCode/Windows):Get-ChildItem -Force
Check the status of your code (any changes made in the Git repository):git status


7. **Additional Notes:**
When cloning the repository, the entire repository with all files (including hidden files like .git) will be copied to your local machine.
If you want to see hidden files or folders in Windows using VSCode, ensure that you have enabled Show Hidden Files in the file explorer sidebar.

That's it! You've successfully created your first GitHub repository and cloned it to your local machine. Feel free to add more content and explore Git further.
